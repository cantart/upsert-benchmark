# upsert-benchmark

This repo explores different strategies to upsert large datasets efficiently into a database, without knowing the database schema at development time.

## ðŸ§  Strategies I am exploring

1. **Naive Upsert**
   - No indexing  
   - Loop through each row â†’ check â†’ insert or update
   - Consumes a lot of CPU and memory

2. **Hash Index Upsert**  
   - Use hash key as unique identifier  
   - Enable fast conflict detection via index

3. **Batching + Hash Index Upsert**  
   - Upsert in chunks to reduce memory usage and transaction cost

## ðŸ“Š How to run benchmark

Run:
```bash
go test -bench=.
```
